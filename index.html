        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
        <p>I'm a unicorn. No, wait, come back! By that I mean that I keep
          hearing that people like me don't exist. (We do, by the way, I know a
          lot of us.) I'm as comfortable with a paint brush as a code editor. As
          capable at capturing form as writing functions. I can draw with pencil
          or pixel or polygon or programming. Do you see me? Or have I faded
          into myth already?</p>
        <p>The natural world, especially the animals that fill it, are my joy
          and inspiration. I appreciate all living things, whether they have
          fur, or feathers, or scales, or chitin. I even respect those that make
          their own food with chlorophyll. Each organism has different ways of
          perceiving the world, and has it's own way of knowing and interacting
          with the environment around them. Take a moment and appreciate that
          our world has creatures living on it that are more bizarre than
          anything you've seen in a science fiction movie. If they can exist,
          surely I can too?</p>
        <p>Technology and nature, art and science, emotion and reason; these are
          not opposites, or even ends of a spectrum. Each is a lens; it allows
          you to see some things clearly while distorting or erasing others. Put
          them on, one at a time or several at once, and look around. Can you
          see me now?</p>

        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Making Games</h3>
        <p>I studied <strong>Digital Media</strong> at <strong>University of
            Denver</strong> for my <strong>Master's of Arts</strong>, with a
          focus on video games. I made several experimental video games as a
          part of my studies, and more after I graduated. I taught game design
          and game programming at the college level for nine years, as well as
          working on some personal projects. My recent games have been made in <strong>Unity</strong>
          (3d/2d games) and the <strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong> (2d games), but
          I've used a variety of tools, including: Godot, Processing, P5,
          OpenFrameworks, Scratch, Stencyl, and straight Java. I'm currently
          experimenting with procedural animation. You can see some of my games
          on <a href="https://blueappaloosa.itch.io/" target="_blank">Itch.io</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Writing Code</h3>
        <p>Prior to my Master's, I acquired a <strong>Bachelor's of Science</strong>
          in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Northern Arizona
            University</strong>. I was particularly interested in User Interface
          Design, Graphics, and the intersection between code and art. I mostly
          use <strong>C#</strong> (for Unity) and <strong>JavaScript</strong>
          (for the HTML5 Canvas) these days, but I've used a variety of
          programming&nbsp; languages, including: Java, C++, C, Python, and PHP;
          and am familiar with related things like: HTML, CSS, MySQL, and AJAX.
          I'm starting to experiment with custom shaders. You can find code
          samples on my <a href="https://github.com/blueappaloosa" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">3d Modelling</h3>
        <p>I create 3d models for games and for 3d printing. My models for game
          are mostly <strong>low-poly<span style="color: #757575;"> animals, </span></strong>and
          I can also <strong>uv-map</strong>, <strong>rig</strong>, <strong>skin</strong>,
          and <strong>animate</strong>. Ive made a study of quadruped movement
          and avian flight and am currently studying arthropod movement. I've
          also created a variety of models for 3d printing, from functional
          replacement parts, to animal skulls, to kinematic models meant for
          wildlife education. I've also generated meshes from CT scans and
          cleaned up meshes generated by other people from both CT/MRI data and
          surface scans. I primarily use <strong>Blender,</strong> but have
          used Maya in the past and sometimes toy with Sculptris for sculpting
          and texture painting, and OpenSCAD for CAD type modelling. You can see
          some of my models on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/BlueAppaloosa" target="_blank">Sketchfab</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">3d Printing</h3>
        <p>During my Master's I was introduced to 3d printing before it became
          feasible for individuals to have 3d printers at home. I currently work
          with mostly <strong>Fused Deposition Modeling</strong> type printers,
          primarily my <strong>Prusa MK4S</strong>, Prusa XL, and a M3D Crane I
          refitted with a Titan extruder. I've recently started doing resin
          printing with the <strong>Anycubic Mono X 6k</strong>. I've learned
          to do my own maintenance and tuning, modify firmware settings, and
          adjust slicer setting, to get the best out of my printers. I'm
          currently mostly using <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong> and <strong>Lychee</strong>
          for slicing. You can find my 3d printed models on my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/blueappaloosastudio/"

            target="_blank">Etsy</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Teaching</h3>
        <p>I've spent the last decade teaching in both formal and informal
          settings. I've taught college courses in Game Design, Game
          Programming, Introduction to Programming, and Web Programming,
          including <strong>face-to-face</strong>, <strong>online</strong>,
          and <strong>hybrid </strong>courses. I have <strong>designed and
            developed</strong> nearly all of the courses I've taught. I've also
          done informal education and outreach including <strong>informational
            booths</strong>, <strong>nature hikes</strong>, and <strong>interactive
            talks</strong> on nature, wildlife, and companion animals. While
          I've become somewhat disillusioned with formal education, I still
          enjoy teaching people about things without the involvement of grades.
        </p>
        <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Critters</h3>
        <p>I've always loved animals. I've had a variety of animals in my life,
          including: <strong>horses</strong>, <strong>dogs</strong>, <strong>cats</strong>,
          <strong>parrots</strong>, as well as various <strong>reptiles</strong>,
          <strong>fish</strong>, and <strong>invertebrates</strong>. I
          volunteered with a <strong>raptor sanctuary</strong> and a <strong>parrot
            rescue</strong> for several years, and have trained and cared for my
          own critters since I was a kid. Animals inspire most of my creative
          works, and I love spending time with them as well as reading and
          learning more about them. </p>
